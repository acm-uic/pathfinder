<p><b><font size=3>Who wrote this and why? </font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sean Deitz and Tom Sakkos<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was a CS398 (Undergraduate Research) project with Professor Theys as our sponsor.
</p>

<p><b><font size=3>How long did this project take you? </font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A semester.  Or eons.  It depends on your relativity.
</p>

<p><b><font size=3>What did you write this in? </font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;English, Python, and the blood of our enemies.
</p>

<p><b><font size=3>What does UMPF stand for?</font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;UIC Mega Path Finder</p>

<p><b><font size=3> Why is it &quot;mega&quot;?</font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why...not?
</p>

<p><b><font size=3>Why does your website look so child-like?</font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks cartoony actually...</p>

<p><b><font size=3>Can I add my professor's office on this?  Why don't you have every room listed? </font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No.  We needed to get permission from the university prior to being able to do this project and they provided a list of the rooms we were allowed to path to.
</p>

<p><b><font size=3>Why didn't you include West Campus? </font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;West Campus?  UIC has a West Campus?
</p>


<p><b><font size=3>Why doesn't the algorithm have me take the door/stairway to the left instead of the right? </font></b><br>
That way is perilous.
</p>

<p><b><font size=3>Can I just have a little peril? </font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No.  It's too much peril.  It's not good for a man.
</p>

<p><b><font size=3>What about that wide open area in front of BSB? </font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There be monsters.
</p>

<p><b><font size=3>Can you update a building to reflect the changes made by construction? </font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No.  If you see this question, that means we're both gone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You could try to convince somebody from the ACM to update it though.  Good luck with that.
</p>

<p><b><font size=3>Can you implement a feature for me? </font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you provide payment :-)
